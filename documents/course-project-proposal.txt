Proposal:
I plan to create a site that allows users to find information regarding a variety of movies. It will likely be a list of my favorite, perhaps lesser-known movies (for the kids today at least). The movies will be listed in alphabetical order and when clicked (or when clicking a Details button - still TBD) will show various details for the movie such as year, rating, release date, runtime, description, etc. I want to include an option to check off the videos seen so the view will change in some way to alert the user they've already seen a movie.

NOTE: I may make some adjustments to this plan as I learn more over this course, but this is generally the plan. If I'm able to find a way to incorporate images (if they are free to use/share) I will do that too.

Objective:
I love movies and I've seen a ton of them. I want to create a fun site that offers folks a way to forget about the problems in the world. I think movies are a great way to escape for a couple of hours and not have to think about yourself or anything else.

API I'll likely use:
